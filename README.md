[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)


This repository contains a **UiPath automation workflow** designed to **bulk mint NFTs** on [Mintable.com](https://mintable.com) efficiently.  
It automates repetitive tasks such as uploading files, filling metadata, and confirming minting actions — saving hours of manual work.
